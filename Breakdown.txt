		Find all permutations of other tree's paths (this will give us the number of rows present in the table)
		Loop permutations (Doesn't matter which order for the path)
			Create Entry with the specified type
			Combine new Path and and current permutation -> Gives a list
			Loop
				Create combined data access path for entry

	B: Create category as a new subcategory parent
		Create Category with the selected parent category
		Get all entries that contain the parent category in the data access path
		Loop entries
			Create a data access path for the new category for current entry
